# QuizApp
This is a quiz app in which user can select the desired category and number of questions. I have used MVVM architecture, Room Persistence, Retrofit and Butterknife libraries in the project

The UI is inspired from this shot on dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/8800506-quiz-app-design-ui
